# BloodPressureEstimation

The ubiquitous impact of hypertension on diverse populations highlights the necessity for precise and non-invasive blood pressure monitoring methods. Effective blood pressure estimation is crucial for improving health outcomes, preventing cardiovascular diseases, and enhancing patient management across varied demographic and health backgrounds. Contemporary research has delved into the potential of various signals, such as electrocardiography (ECG) and photoplethysmography (PPG), to accurately measure blood pressure. The advent of deep learning technologies has notably advanced this field, offering sophisticated frameworks capable of processing complex and high-dimensional data while extracting significant features autonomously. This project utilizes a deep learning architecture based on the UNet model, integrating dual-input channels from ECG and PPG, to refine the approach to blood pressure estimation. Through a series of unimodal and multimodal experiments, this study demonstrates the efficacy of the multimodal method, significantly outperforming unimodal approaches, and achieves the lowest mean absolute errors in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure predictions. This approach not only enhances the accuracy of blood pressure monitoring but also paves the way for the development of reliable, non-invasive wearable health monitoring devices.
